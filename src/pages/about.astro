      I am a passionate software engineer with a deep love for technology. I am
      enthusiastic about learning new programming languages, frameworks, and
      workplace skills to continuously improve and innovate in every project.
      <br /><br />
      On a personal level, I am a Formula One enthusiast, with an allegiance
      to McLaren. My love for video games and pop culture runs deep. I am a PlayStation fanboy and my all-time favourite movie is The Dark Knight.
